#UNE - Luke Norris - COSC360 ASSIGNMENT 2 - GOMOKU React

1. install dependencies: 'yarn'
2. start the app: 'npm start'
go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Additional Feature:
I thought the home page was boring compared to the other pages
I added a random board from the completed boards to the page which I thought would make people want to play more
The board is similar to the History board but doesn't display the winner, instead  it shows the board number for reference
